# Quiz Game

Project created with the intention of practicing more about component creation and putting into practice what I have already learned in courses. It is an application that simulates a question and answer game. The questions are randomly generated through an API. You select the option you believe is correct, and the result is immediately recorded and displayed on the screen, generating a score.

## Run the project

In the project's root folder, run the command `npm install` to download the necessary dependencies, and then execute the command `npm run serve` to launch it in your browser by accessing the localhost link that will appear in your terminal.
